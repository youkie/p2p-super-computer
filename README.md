p2p-super-computer
==================

This project is going to develp a P2P core for any P2P applications. This is an OS running on P2P.

1.The PSP OS data shorage mechanics
 All application data are distribute store in nodes.
 Every nodes has a fraction of the whole system data.
 In order not to lost data once a node disconnected, all system data fraction must have at least 2 copys around all the  P2P network.
 The healthy of the entire P2P OS is indicated by the redundant of the fractions. However, to utilise the max source of  this P2P OS, this redundant shall be kept among a resonable range.
